<h1>Power Utility Data Analysis Toolkit</h1>

 ### [Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
The project involves the creation of Python functions tailored for numerical metric computation and textual data processing on two CSV files. One file contains data of electrification per province in South Africa between financial years, while the other contains extracted tweets. 

Developed functions encompass statistical analysis, date parsing, hashtag and municipality extraction, tweet frequency determination, word splitting, and stop word removal. These functions are specifically designed to handle data extracted from power utility records and Twitter feeds efficiently. This repository serves as a resource for enhancing data analysis capabilities, facilitating informed decision-making processes through comprehensive data extraction and analysis techniques.
